## Project Overview
This Lost and Found System aims to centralize the process of reporting and finding lost items for students. Traditionally, students would post on platforms like Dcard or Facebook groups, which made the search process inconvenient. This system allows registered users to report lost/found items, manage posts, and search for lost items more efficiently.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Users must register and log in to the platform to post and manage lost/found items.
   - Admins can verify user identities for security.

2. **Post Lost/Found Items**:
   - Users can post details such as item descriptions, lost/found location, and contact information.

3. **Search Posts (Upcoming Feature)**:
   - A keyword search feature will allow users to search for posts based on item details, time, and location.

4. **Respond to Posts**:
   - Users can respond to posts, either browsing by categories or directly interacting with posts.

5. **Personal Dashboard**:
   - Users can view and manage their own lost/found posts, with options to edit, update, or delete them.

6. **Item Categorization**:
   - Items are categorized (e.g., electronics, personal documents, books) to facilitate search and management.

7. **Matching and Notification System (Partially Implemented)**:
   - The system can automatically match lost and found items and notify users via email.

8. **Admin Post Management**:
   - Admins can manage posts, including editing or deleting inappropriate content.

9. **Automatic Updates**:
   - Once an item is retrieved, the system automatically updates the item's status.

2. Clone the project from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marjasback2bedge/Db_project.git
   ```
3. Locate the `php.ini` file and enable the GD library:
   ```ini
   ;extension=gd â†’ extension=gd
   ```
4. Place the project in the `/XAMPP/htdocs` directory.
5. Open XAMPP and activate Apache and MySQL.
6. Create a database named `project` and execute the `project_DDL.sql` file in `phpMyAdmin`.
7. Access the system via `http://localhost/db_project/`.

### Default Admin Credentials:
